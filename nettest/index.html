        DNS consistency This test compares the DNS query results from a DNS resolver which is considered to be reliable with one that is tested for tampering. The domain name system (DNS) is what is responsible for transforming a host name (e.g. torproject.org) into an IP address (e.g. 38.229.72.16). ISPs, amongst others, run DNS resolvers which map IP addresses to host names. In certain circumstances though, ISPs map the wrong IP addresses to the wrong host names.

It does so by handling a client&rsquo;s request to connect to a server, and a server&rsquo;s response to a client&rsquo;s request.

        HTTP Header Field Manipulation This test tries to detect the presence of network components (“middle box”) which could be responsible for censorship and/or traffic manipulation. HTTP is a protocol which transfers or exchanges data across the internet. It does so by handling a client&rsquo;s request to connect to a server, and a server&rsquo;s response to a client&rsquo;s request. Every time you connect to a server, you (the client) send a request through the HTTP protocol to that server.

        <p>
        HTTP invalid request line This test tries to detect the presence of network components (“middle box”) which could be responsible for censorship and/or traffic manipulation. Instead of sending a normal HTTP request, this test sends an invalid HTTP request line - containing an invalid HTTP version number, an invalid field count and a huge request method – to an echo service listening on the standard HTTP port. An echo service is a very useful debugging and measurement tool, which simply sends back to the originating source any data it receives.

        HTTP Requests This test tries to detect online censorship based on a comparison of HTTP requests over Tor and over the network of the user. HTTP is a protocol which allows communication between a client and a server. It does so by handling a client&rsquo;s request to connect to a server, and a server&rsquo;s response to a client&rsquo;s request. Every time you connect to a website, your browser (the client) sends a request through the HTTP protocol to the server which is hosting that website.

        Meek Fronted Requests This test examines whether the domains used by Meek (a type of Tor bridge) work in tested networks. Meek is a pluggable transport which uses non-blocked domains, such as google.com, awsstatic.com (Amazon cloud infrastructure) and ajax.aspnetcdn.com (Microsoft azure cloud infrastructure), to proxy its users over Tor to blocked websites, while hiding both the fact that they are connecting to such websites and how they are connecting to them.

        Lantern This test provides an automated way of examining whether Lantern works in a tested network. Lantern is a centralized and peer-to-peer proxy, which is used as a circumvention tool. It detects whether websites are blocked and, if so, it allows you to access them via Lantern servers or via the network of Lantern users. This test runs Lantern and checks to see if it is working. If it&rsquo;s able to connect to a Lantern server and reach a control website over it, then we consider that Lantern can be used for censorship circumvention within the tested network.

If it&rsquo;s able to connect to a Psiphon server and reach a website over it, then we consider that Psiphon can be used for censorship circumvention within the tested network.

        Tor Bridge Reachability This test examines whether Tor bridges work in tested networks. Tor is free and open source software which enables online anonymity and censorship circumvention. It was designed to bounce communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers around the world, thus hiding users&rsquo; IP address and circumventing online tracking and censorship. However, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in various countries around the world are often ordered by their governments to block users&rsquo; access to Tor.

        Web connectivity This test examines whether websites are reachable and if they are not, it attempts to determine whether access to them is blocked through DNS tampering, TCP connection RST/IP blocking or by a transparent HTTP proxy. Specifically, this test is designed to perform the following: Resolver identification DNS lookup TCP connect HTTP GET request By default, this test performs the above (excluding the first step, which is performed only over the network of the user) both over a control server and over the network of the user.
