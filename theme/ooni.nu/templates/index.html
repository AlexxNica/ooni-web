    <h2>Open Methodologies</h2>
    <p>
    By having openly known and peer reviewed methodologies, we able to produce
    data that is of scientific value. We believe in the importance of
    reproducible research, meaning that any researcher should be able to obtain
    the same results independently. This can only be achieved by detailing the
    methods we use in our experiments in plain English as well as in code. We
    plan to set the standards for best practices in developing network
    surveillance and filtering detection tests.  Focusing on the creation and
    utilization of tests based on open methods will allow us to build a
    taxonomy of surveillance and censorship. This will expand the ability of
    the larger community to independently implement tests, perform experiments,
    and reference specifics.

    <h2>Free Software</h2>
    <p>
    Making the tool available as Free Libre Open Source Software allows
    researchers to fully grasp the inner workings of the software, and it allows
    the building of a strong skillful community around OONI. People interested
    in expanding it will be able to do so freely, which will help sustain it as a
    basis for future work. A FL/OSS tool has the most likely chance of being
    studied and improved by the research community.

    <h2>Open Data</h2>
    <p>
     It is very important that all of the data collected by OONI is released to
     the public under an Open license such as the Creative Commons by Attribution
     license. This allows anybody to freely use and republish this information as
     they wish without restriction. The publishing of scientific data is in line
     with the Open Science data movement â€“ the rate of discovery and scientific
     progress is accelerated by better access to data. While other projects have
     attempted to share data, we assert that high level summaries are simply not
     enough. We wish to ensure that open access to data submitted is available to
     all and that techniques for analysis will be equally available. This will
     allow for factual assertions based on the data collected rather than on
     organizational reputation alone. While we think that this model may have
     risks, no project has resolved such risks by refusing to publish their
     datasets. At best, hiding data may stop casual attackers, and, at worst, it
     creates a very valuable target for attack.
